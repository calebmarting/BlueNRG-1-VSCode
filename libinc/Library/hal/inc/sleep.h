* \section Library BlueNRG-1, BlueNRG-2 Low Power management 

  - The BlueNRG-1, BlueNRG-2 low power software combines the low power requests coming from 
    the application with the radio operating mode, choosing the best low power mode 
    applicable in the current scenario.
    - This negotiation between the radio module and the application requests prevents data loss
    and it is performed by the low power software APIs. User is requested to call the BlueNRG_Sleep(SleepModes sleepMode, uint8_t gpioWakeBitMask, uint8_t gpioWakeLevelMask) API.
    - Refer to AN4820 "BlueNRG-1 and BlueNRG-2 low power modes" document for detailed description about the devices HW low power modes and SW support. 

* \section  Sleep_API How BlueNRG_Sleep() API works?  

  - BlueNRG_Sleep(SleepModes sleepMode, uint8_t gpioWakeBitMask, uint8_t gpioWakeLevelMask) must be 
    called on main application while loop, with selected sleep mode (SLEEPMODE_RUNNING, SLEEPMODE_CPU_HALT,SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER,SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER),
    gpio bit masks and level for selecting the external wakup source if applicable.
    - BlueNRG_Sleep() API sets the actual sleep mode value (sleepMode_allowed variable) as combination of following components: 
        - BlueNRG_Sleep() sleepMode parameter value
        - user sleep mode provided within App_SleepMode_Check() function
	- BLE Stack sleep mode returned from BlueNRG_Stack_Perform_Deep_Sleep_Check() function.

      - sleepMode_allowed value determines actual sleep mode and associated actions:
        - SLEEPMODE_RUNNING: 
          - It just reenables global interrupt operations (nothing else to be done);
        - SLEEPMODE_CPU_HALT: 
          - __WFI() is called: it executes a wait for interrupt instruction and suspends the core execution until one of a number of events occurs.
          - Global interrupt operations are re-enabled. 
        - SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER, SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER:
          - BlueNRG_InternalSleep(sleepMode_allowed, gpioWakeBitMask) is called, after wakeup sources setup. 
     
   * \section Sleep_Modes  How BlueNRG_InternalSleep() API works? (SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER, SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER sleep modes)   

      - When the BlueNRG-1 and BlueNRG-2 exit from SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER, SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER low power mode a reset occurs: all the
          peripherals configuration and the application context are lost.
        - The BlueNRG_InternalSleep() API implements a mechanism to save and restore all the peripheral configuration and the application context when a power save procedure is called.

        - BlueNRG_InternalSleep(sleepMode_allowed, gpioWakeBitMask) performs the following main operations in order to enter in sleep mode (SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER, SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER)  and restore context:

          - Save the peripherals registers configurations on dedicated variables: System Control, FLASH CONFIG, NVIC, CKGEN, GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, RNG, RNG, RTC, MFTX, SysTick, WDT, DMA, ADC, PKA.
          - Enable deep sleep: SystemSleepCmd(ENABLE);
          - Save the context by calling the calling the CS_contextSave() function on context_switch.s file.

        - When BlueNRG-1 and BlueNRG-2 exit from SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER, SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER low power mode due to a wakeup reason, a reset occurs. The following main operations are done:

          - On reset the __low_level_init() function is called which checks the reset reason:
             - Since the reset reason is a wakeup from sleep, it restores the context by calling the CS_contextRestore() function on context_switch.s file.             
          - Disable deep sleep (SystemSleepCmd(DISABLE))
          - Restore the peripherals registers configuration previously saved on dedicated variables  FLASH CONFIG, NVIC, CKGEN, UART, SPI, I2C, RNG, RNG, RTC, MFTX, SysTick, WDT, DMA, ADC, PKA.

          - NOTE: From the application point of view, the exit from a low power procedure is fully transparent: when a wakeup from low power occurs, the CPU executes the next instruction after the low power function call.

  * \section Wakeup_WFI How to properly handle device entering in the Sleep mode with a wakeup source from GPIO active?

      If the user application wants to enter in sleep mode (SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER or SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER) and starts the sleep procedure with a wakeup source
      from GPIO already active, the system does not switch the power management off and remains blocked in the WFI instruction until an interrupt occurs. 
      In this context, if other defined wakeup sources occur, they are ignored. The only way to restart the code execution is through an interrupt occurring from any peripheral. 
      In addition to user specific needs, it is MANDATORY to enable, at NVIC level and GPIO level, the interrupt associated with the GPIO wakeup sources as follow:
        - If wakeup source level is LOW, the associated IRQ level must be on falling edge (IRQ_ON_FALLING_EDGE);
        - If wakeup source level is HIGH, the associated IRQ level must be on rising edge (IRQ_ON_RISING_EDGE). 
      The GPIO handler should handle also the interrupt associated with the edges, by clearing the interrupt cause. 
      If the application needs also GPIO interrupt on the other edge, it could enable both edges and discard the edge not needed in the GPIO handler. 

      - Example: let's assume the wakeup source is IO13 with LOW level and no specific interrupt is enabled and associated to this IO at application level. 
                 User must enable, at NVIC level, the interrupt on IO13 with IRQ level on falling edge.

        - while (1) {
              BTLE_StackTick();

              wakeup_source = WAKEUP_IO13;
              wakeup_level = (WAKEUP_IO_LOW << WAKEUP_IO13);  

              <enable IO13 interrupt with IRQ level on falling edge since wakeup level is LOW (IRQ_ON_FALLING_EDGE)>

              BlueNRG_Sleep(SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER, wakeup_source, wakeup_level, 0);
            }

  * \section Wakeup_Reason How to properly handle a wakeup source from a wakeup GPIO (IO9, 10,11,12,13) for which an interrupt is also expected ?

      When in sleep mode, if a wakeup with associated IRQ handler occurs on a wakeup IO, the device is waked up, but the related IO user operations on associated IRQ handler cannot be properly handled.
      This is due to the fact that an event on such IO allows to wake up the device in sleep mode, but, since the GPIO peripheral is in sleep mode, the associated IT pending bit is not set. 
      As consequence, on associated GpioHandler(), user application is not able to correctly check the IT pending bit and perform the related operations. 

      After existing from sleep mode, the following checks on associated IO handler (GpioHandler()) must be performed:

      - use wakeupFromSleepFlag flag to verify that device actually exits from sleep mode and check if the wakeup source is the one associated to the specific IO (by using BlueNRG_WakeupSource() API). 

      - Example: let's assume the wakeup source is IO12 and user application requires to perform specific operations on associated IRQ function (GPIO_handler()).

          - On main application user enables the  sleep mode by setting IO12 as wakeup source: 
              
            BlueNRG_Sleep(SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER,WAKEUP_I12,WAKEUP_IOx_LOW<< WAKEUP_I12_SHIFT_MASK);    

          - On BlueNRG1_it.c, the following changes must be applied on GPIO_Handler() function:

             void GPIO_Handler(void)
             {
                if ((GPIO_GetITPendingBit(GPIO_Pin_12) == SET) || ((wakeupFromSleepFlag) && (BlueNRG_WakeupSource() & WAKEUP_IO12)))
                {
                    GPIO_ClearITPendingBit(GPIO_Pin_12);

                    ... //User code to be executed when IRQ on IO12 occurs
                }
             }
