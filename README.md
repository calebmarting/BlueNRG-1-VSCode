# BlueNRG-1-VSCode
This repo is a template for setting up VSCode to compile and debug code for the EMB-1061 BlueNRG-1 module

## Please note:
This is an ongoing project and there are some issues and jank. Things like printing floats may not work correctly. Please take this into account when you decide to use this chip.

It's still better than paying $1500 a year for licenses to IAR or MDK5 though...

## Setup
1. [Fork this template](https://github.com/ctjet/BlueNRG-1-VSCode/generate) for your own project and clone to your computer
2. Download and install VSCode and open your cloned project
3. Install the Cortex-Debug extension by marus25
    1. Search marus25.cortex-debug in the extensions menu and install
4. Install the [Arm Cortex Debug Tools](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
